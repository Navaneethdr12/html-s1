    <p >A web browser is a software application used to access and display content from the World Wide Web, including webpages, websites, and other online resources.
 Webpages are individual documents, typically written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that are hosted on web servers ,<a href="https://www.google.com/">google.com</a> and accessed via a unique web address, known as a URL.
 When a user enters a URL into a browser, the browser retrieves the webpage's files from the server and renders them into a visual, interactive experience on the user's device.</p>

 <h2>To create a webpage</h2>
 <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages, defining their layout and content using elements and tags.
 It serves as the foundational language for building websites, from simple pages to complex web applications.
 To create a basic HTML webpage, you start by setting up an HTML document using a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code.
 The document begins with the &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt declaration, which defines the document as an HTML5 file.
 The &lthtml&gt element acts as the root container for all other elements on the page.</p>

<p>The structure of an HTML document typically includes a &lthead&gt section for metadata and a &ltbody&gt section for the visible content.
 The &lthead&gt contains the &lttitle&gt element, which specifies the title of the webpage displayed in the browser's tab.
 The &ltbody&gt element is a container for all visible content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and lists.
 For example, a simple webpage can be created with a heading (&lth1&gt), a paragraph (&ltp&gt), and an image (&ltimg&gt).
 The image tag uses the src attribute to specify the image's source and the alt attribute to provide alternative text if the image fails to load.</p>

<p>HTML elements are formed by a start tag, content, and an end tag, such as &ltp&gtSome text&lt/p&gt.
 Tags like &lta&gt are used to create hyperlinks, allowing navigation between web pages.
 Attributes, which are added within the opening tag, provide additional information about an element, such as the href attribute for links or the src attribute for images.
 HTML also supports creating lists (ordered &ltol&gt and unordered &ltul&gt), tables (&lttable&gt), and forms (&ltform&gt) for interactive input.
 To enhance the visual presentation, HTML is often combined with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is used to style the layout and design of the webpage.</p>

<p>Creating a website involves organizing the code with proper structure and indentation for readability and maintainability.
 Best practices include using semantic HTML elements like &ltheader&gt, &ltnav&gt, &ltsection&gt, &ltarticle&gt, and &ltfooter&gt to improve accessibility and SEO.
 It is also recommended to validate HTML code using a validator to ensure it is free of syntax errors.
 A well-structured folder system, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and images, helps manage the project efficiently.
 Once the webpage is created, it can be saved with an .html extension and opened in any web browser to view the result.</p>
    <h1>Web Browsers</h1>
    <p>A web browser acts as an interface between the user and the web, fetching data from web servers and displaying it as a webpage.
 It uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or its secure variant HTTPS to communicate with servers.
Webpages are the fundamental units of the web, containing text, images, video, and other multimedia elements, and are linked together through hyperlinks.
The browser's rendering engine processes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create the visual layout and functionality of the webpage.
Modern browsers offer features like tabbed browsing, bookmarks, history, and caching to enhance navigation and performance.
While a web browser is the tool for accessing the web, a search engine (like Google) is a specific type of website used to find other websites and resources.</p>
