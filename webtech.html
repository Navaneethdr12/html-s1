        <p>The client–server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the
            providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.[1] Often clients
            and servers communicate over a computer network on separate hardware, but both client and server may be on
            the same device. A server host runs one or more server programs, which share their resources with clients. A
            client usually does not share its computing resources, but it requests content or service from a server and
            may share its own content as part of the request. Clients, therefore, initiate communication sessions with
            servers, which await incoming requests.

            An HTTP connection is a communication link established between a client (like a web browser) and a server to
            transfer data using the HTTP protocol.
            This connection is typically created through a multi-step process, beginning with a three-way handshake to
            establish a TCP connection, which forms the underlying transport layer for HTTP communication.
            The client initiates this connection, often on port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS, although other ports
            can be used.

            Once the TCP connection is established, the client sends an HTTP request, which consists of a request line
            (containing the method, URI, and HTTP version), headers providing additional information, and optionally a
            body with data.
            The server processes this request, generates an HTTP response, and sends it back over the same connection.
            The response includes a status line with a status code and reason phrase, followed by headers and
            potentially a body with the requested data.
        </p>
        <img src="https://imgs.search.brave.com/KnrS6YaGfpPJ6LcQBjREBs6OznmkcvIdWXb1uAfEOjE/rs:fit:860:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9tZWRp/YS5nZWVrc2Zvcmdl/ZWtzLm9yZy93cC1j/b250ZW50L3VwbG9h/ZHMvMjAyNDAzMTIx/NjE4NTEvSFRUUF8y/LXZzLUhUVFBfMy0x/MDI0LmpwZw">
        <p>
            HTTP connections can be either short-lived or persistent. In HTTP/1.0, connections were typically closed
            after a single request-response cycle.
            However, HTTP/1.1 introduced persistent connections, also known as keep-alive connections, where the same
            TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests and responses, reducing the overhead of repeatedly
            establishing new connections.
            The Connection: keep-alive header is used to request this persistent behavior.
            The connection remains open until either the client or server decides to close it, often due to inactivity
            or a Connection: close header in the response.

            An application server is a server that hosts applications or software that delivers a business
            application through a communication protocol. For a typical web application, the application server sits
            behind the web servers.

            An application server framework is a service layer model. It includes software components available to a
            software developer through an application programming interface. An application server may have features
            such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing. The goal is for developers to focus on the business
            logic.
